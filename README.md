# John Keppe – Resume Site

This is my hand‑built, HTML/CSS résumé hosted on GitHub Pages. I created it as a way to practice front‑end fundamentals, version control, and clear information design while transitioning into early‑career data and systems work.

## 🎯 Purpose
This site gives me a space to present my experience, projects, and learning journey in a clean, accessible format. It also serves as a practical exercise in:
- Writing semantic HTML  
- Structuring content for readability  
- Applying simple, responsive CSS  
- Using GitHub for version control and deployment  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **HTML5** – page structure and layout  
- **CSS3** – styling and responsive adjustments  
- **GitHub Pages** – hosting and deployment  
- **Markdown** – documentation  
- **Copilot** – guidance, troubleshooting, and refining code structure  

## 📚 What I Learned
Building this site helped me strengthen:
- Front‑end fundamentals (HTML/CSS)  
- Organizing content for clarity and accessibility  
- Managing files and updates through Git/GitHub  
- Using AI tools to support learning and problem‑solving  
- Iterating on design through small, incremental improvements
